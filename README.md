#Project name:
April 7, 2015
It was a fun day - instead of thinking about solving the problem, give us in practice, I have a lot of ideas on the concept. And, as a result of these creative trends I had an idea for a new game. I decided to call it a "Year 9999".

About the story, the general idea, as well as about the meaning of the name is not going to tell, because not everything is thought out and resolved.
